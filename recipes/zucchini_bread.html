<h1 class="recipe-name">Max's Zucchini Bread</h1>
    <p>This is my own personal recipe that I created from inspiration of many others but there was always something missing. I had a huge supply of zucchini from the garden and was desperate for a solution. I pieced together this recipe and gave away tons of bread to all my neighbors. They loved it so much and begged for the recipe. One neighbor in particular asked for it every time we crossed paths. But since I'd never written it down, it was such an undertaking that I never got around to it. One day, I learned that neighbor had passed away from cancer and I'd never get the chance to give her the recipe. So I finally sat down and pieced it together all over again and am now commited to giving it away to as many people as possible.</p>
