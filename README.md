<h1>Project: Foundations - Recipes</h1>

<p>Welcome to my Foundations--Recipes project! 

I will be creating a simplistic webpage that showcases a few of my own personal recipes. The goal is to apply HTML and CSS skills that I've learned through The Odin Project's Foundations course and demonstrate my understanding of structing a webpage and styling it.</p>

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>HTML Structure: Recipes will be listed with HTML tags including headings, paragraphs, links, images, and ordered/non-ordered lists.</li>
        <li>Git Version Control: Throughout the project, I have used Git to track changes and manage versions of my code.</li>
        <li>Code Writing: Per the guidelines in the Foundations course, I will have completed this project utilizing the command line in conjuction with VSCode.
        <li>CSS Styling: </li>
    </ol>
